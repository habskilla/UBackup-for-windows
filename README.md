# UBackup-for-windows
Powershell script to upload files to UseNet.  I didn't see anything out there to do it via Windows batch.
This is my first powershell script.  So, please, keep, that, in, mind.  :)

I've uploaded this file and a couple of programs you'll need to make it all work.  Look in packaged-installs.
I did not include winrar...You probably have it installed
It's very important to use v1.0.343 of yEncBinPoster included. See this reddit thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/3esv98/looking_for_a_windows_command_line_exe_to_post/

Don't forget to configure yEncBinPoster :)

SPACES ARE EVIL!!!
Install rar, mulitpar, and yEncBinPoster_1.0.343 in a path with no SPACES!!!

My dir structure

usenet
 --MultiPar
 --RAR
 --yEncBin_Poster
